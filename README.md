## Overview
Front End Mentor Challenge, to build a sign up sheet.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Receive an error message when the `form` is submitted if:
  - Any `input` field is empty. The message for this error should say *"[Field Name] cannot be empty"*
  - The email address is not formatted correctly (i.e. a correct email address should have this structure: `name@host.tld`). The message for this error should say *"Looks like this is not an email"*

## My process
I started with the mobile view imported pure.css and the fonts made the colour root etc., from there I went to the desktop. Then when I went to finish the project and make the readme I realized there was a validation part. For this part there was quite a bit of trial and error, I tried to insert the error messages for each of the inserts under the textbox, then I made a placeholder with an h6, that caused too much spacing and looked weird, and so then I decided to actually just change the placeholder text and the border colour which I think is a much nicer design. The validation includes, verifying all the boxes have a value, each one has a value, and if the email value is an actual email string, there could be other validation checks but the full form must be filled out no matter which way it is to be submitted. 

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
